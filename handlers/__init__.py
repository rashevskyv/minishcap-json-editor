# This file makes Python treat the 'handlers' directory as a package.
# For direct imports (not running as -m package), its primary role is organization.
# You can import classes here for convenience if you wish, but it's not strictly necessary
# for the direct import strategy.
# Example:
# from handlers.list_selection_handler import ListSelectionHandler
# from handlers.text_operation_handler import TextOperationHandler
# from handlers.app_action_handler import AppActionHandler
