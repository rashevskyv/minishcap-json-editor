# --- START OF FILE plugins/common/markers.py ---
"""
Common visual markers used by plugins and utility modules.

These constants were originally defined in plugins/pokemon_fr/config.py,
but are needed by core utils (utils.py, syntax_highlighter.py).
Moving them here breaks the circular dependency where low-level modules
import from high-level plugin packages.
